# BookBuddy

> AI-powered book recommendation engine built on Cloudflare Workers.

---

## Overview

**BookBuddy** is an AI-driven book suggestion and wishlist system built entirely on Cloudflare’s edge stack.  
Users describe the kind of book they want and get real-time recommendations generated by **Llama 3** running on **Workers AI**.

It also includes a **wishlist feature** that lets users save books they want to read, add notes, and access that data instantly anywhere, powered currently by **Cloudflare KV** (and also **Durable Objects** previously).

This project was built to demonstrate how Cloudflare’s AI and edge tools can work together to create a full-stack, low-latency AI product with no traditional backend.

## Notes
- I have used both Durable Objects and KV for this. You can see its implementations in my previous commits.
- I had no shortage of bugs and issues throughout this project but it taught me a lot about Cloudflare's stack and super awesome tools that I can use to build efficient software

This was built as a focused exploration of Cloudflare’s AI and edge compute capabilities.  
The main goal was to show how a complete, responsive, and persistent AI app can be built and deployed entirely inside Cloudflare’s ecosystem without needing external APIs, servers, or databases.
I hope you enjoyed! Let me know if you have any questions/comments.
