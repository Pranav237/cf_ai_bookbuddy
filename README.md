## Overview
**BookBuddy** is an AI-powered book recommendation agent built on **Cloudflare Workers AI**.  
Users describe the kind of book experience they want. Mood, themes, or titles they like and pretty much anything will be considered as valid input. Then, the user will receive personalized recommendations generated by **Llama 3**.  
The app also includes a **wishlist** feature, stored at the edge using **Cloudflare KV / Durable Objects**.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Cloudflare Workers AI**: Llama 3 for recommendation logic  
- **Cloudflare Workers**: API routes & workflow coordination  
- **Cloudflare KV / Durable Objects**: Persistent state (wishlist)  
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Frontend UI  
- **Wrangler CLI**: Build & deployment  

---
